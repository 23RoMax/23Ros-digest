      <description>Recently one of my best friends married, and I took the honor of being his best man. The wedding took place in a historical franconian castle.

      <description>My daily commute to work includes walking a beautiful strip of berlin roads. Namely: Prinzenstraße, and its side-, and crossroads.

However, this beautiful path is frequently destroyed by what I encounter there&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Information: This went live initially on 2018-04-09 at 00:44:51+02:00 I decided to move this very nice first landing page to the posts sections, as it rather appears to me as a real post.
A primer This is dedicated to all the time spent in front of computers. Finding a true way to express oneself in projects, and beginning to make a small private blog a habit. In all it&amp;rsquo;s glory, I will present you, the humble inventions, findings, and collections of myself, friends, family and fools.</description>
