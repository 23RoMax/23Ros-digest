      <description>A primer This is dedicated to all the time spent in front of computers. Finding a true way to express oneself in projects. In all it&amp;rsquo;s glory, I will present you, the humble inventions, findings, and collections of myself, friends, family and fools. This website is built with hugo, where content is mainly written in markdown and insanely fast converted to a static website. I write about technology, the business world around development, software engineering, my hobbies and little projects that I pursue to keep life interesting.</description>
