      <description>Second entry - first commit After setting things up initially in a Mac environment and creating a new post, why not doing the same for windows? &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Bad idead
Still, I&amp;rsquo;m getting it and slowly things are coming together Setting Hugo up on a windows machine is not utterly complex, but also not as fluent of an experience as on linux, or mac. One might wonder why I have to deal with three different environments at all?</description>

      <description>Initial Entry - no commit Just doing the setup like described in the quickstart.
I&amp;rsquo;m trying to figure out what I&amp;rsquo;m doing here So setting up hugo was a smooth experience on my macbook.
1st Step:
Installing the depencie via brew install hugo
2nd Step:
Installing the desired them as a submodule via git add submodule &amp;lt;ADD_URI_TO_DESIRED_THEME_GIT&amp;gt; &amp;lt;PATH_IF_NECESSARY&amp;gt;;
3rd Step:
Adding a first post via hugo new posts/a-new-day-with-hugo.md
Et voil√† and here we are.</description>
