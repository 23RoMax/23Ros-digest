      <description>Information: This went live initially on 2018-04-09 at 00:44:51+02:00 I decided to move this very nice first landing page to the posts sections, as it rather appears to me as a real post.
A primer This is dedicated to all the time spent in front of computers. Finding a true way to express oneself in projects, and beginning to make a small private blog a habit. In all it&amp;rsquo;s glory, I will present you, the humble inventions, findings, and collections of myself, friends, family and fools.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my first snippet addition to this website. I hope you find this as helpful as I find it sometimes.
Why would I need this? Imagine you want to fill a field of a table with a sequenctially value, but do not have any ID for a sequence and are using PostgreSQL, and you also already have information in this table that you want to append on. Well there is this option to use the internal ID (CID) provided by PostgreSQL, but this only works to a certain extent.</description>

      <description>Second entry - first commit After setting things up initially in a Mac environment and creating a new post, why not doing the same for windows? &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Bad idead
Still, I&amp;rsquo;m getting it and slowly things are coming together Setting Hugo up on a windows machine is not utterly complex, but also not as fluent of an experience as on linux, or mac. One might wonder why I have to deal with three different environments at all?</description>

      <description>Initial Entry - no commit Just doing the setup like described in the quickstart.
I&amp;rsquo;m trying to figure out what I&amp;rsquo;m doing here So setting up hugo was a smooth experience on my macbook.
1st Step:
Installing the depencie via brew install hugo
2nd Step:
Installing the desired them as a submodule via git add submodule &amp;lt;ADD_URI_TO_DESIRED_THEME_GIT&amp;gt; &amp;lt;PATH_IF_NECESSARY&amp;gt;;
3rd Step:
Adding a first post via hugo new posts/a-new-day-with-hugo.md
Et voil√† and here we are.</description>
