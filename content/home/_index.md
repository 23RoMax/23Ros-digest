# A primer

This is dedicated to all the time spent in front of my computers. Exploring new projects, oportunities and studying. In all it's glory, I present you, the humble inventions, findings, and collections of myself, friends, family and fools. This website is built with [hugo](https://www.gohugo.io), where content is mainly written in markdown and insanely fast converted to a static website - it's fun.

I tend to write about all sorts of technology, sometimes about the business world around development, software engineering, my hobbies and little projects that I pursue to keep life interesting.

## Who am I

My name is Maximilian and I also go by the cryptic name 23Ro. I'm a product owner, professional bug catcher, and developer myself. My skillset is based on a technological foundation, with some outreaches to academical economics, but I went quickly back to the more technical side of things working my way steadily up the stream of challenges we encounter on a daily basis combining the world of development, product management, and non-technical business tasks. If you want to checkout some of the software projects I am, or I was involved in, check out [this](https://www.new-thread.de), [this](https://freebusy.app/), [this](https://bav-werkzeug.de/) and [that](https://www.tillhub.de).

To find out more, you can also find me on these various platform:

On a sidenote - I might not be active on instagram anymore from end of year 2019 as it consumed too much of my time/I wasted too much time on scrolling through their feed -  but I kind of made my own instagram: find my photography journey [here](https://23ro.photography/).

### What I do here

Sharing information about before mentioned topics is what you will mostly find here. There is no intention of monetization at all.

I dedicated this project to all the time spent in front of computers taking part in forming the modern world. We all contribute to a better understanding, if we share information that has been either shared with, or compiled by us. I deeply believe that everyone who has information worth sharing, should do so without contempt. However, if there is wrong information shared, or information of low quality, it can also have negative effects. If you find things interesting here, and/or learn something, I'm glad I could help.

If you feel like I missed a point, or I'm sharing wrong information, please feel free to reach out to me and contribute.

## Where am I

Based and located in Berlin, Germany. Initially spawned in the most northern southern part of Germany (upper franconia), Coburg, I set out to do my things and eventually had the chance to live in several places on this planet during the last couple of years. Now I'm settled for good (at least for now) in Berlin.
