## Work

My profession and passion is programming.
My CV can be found on github:

- [Source in Roff](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/23RoMax/cv/main/resume.ms)
- [Rendered PDF](https://github.com/23RoMax/cv/blob/main/pdf/resume.pdf)

I operate multiple companies, most notably...

- [AGXWorld](https://agxworld.com/)

> Where I am currently serving as Director & CTO (+Co-Founder). We develop a modern technology suite for logistics. It's a very specific solution for the vertical, and a fascinating approach to digitalizing a very rusty industry that has patches of software solutions here and there, but lacks vision and the drive to glue things together.

> My own software development and tech consulting firm. [Our services](https://new-thread.de/work-with-us/) range from:
>
> - Interim CTO
> - Application Development
> - System Architecture/Design
> - Consulting
> - Prototyping, 3D Printing

Previously I worked as a programmer, head of product, professional bug catcher, and swiss army knife at a [fintech company in Berlin](https://www.tillhub.de).

Other noteable projects are:

- [Spuffle\* Shuffler: shuffle public spotify playlist and generate a new one](https://spuffle-shuffler.web.app/#/)
- [Meeting Activity Display based on google calendars free-busy API](https://freebusy.app)
- [BAV Rechner (unmaintained)](https://bav-werkzeug.de)
- Conego - Helium Hotspot Hosting & LoRa Network Provider (dissolved)

\* My project is not [spuffle.net](https://spuffle.net/) - seems like someone had the same idea :)
