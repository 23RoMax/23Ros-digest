## This is the personal webpage of Maximilian Nebl (aka 23Ro)

Here you can find content I create. I don't write very often. Topics that interest me, and what I likely write about are:
- technology around programming
- management around software development
- camera gear
- 3d printing
- general other hobbies

You can find the content by [tag here](/tags/).

## Work

My CV can be found on github:
- [Source in Roff](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/23RoMax/cv/main/resume.ms)
- [Rendered PDF](https://github.com/23RoMax/cv/blob/main/pdf/resume.pdf)

My profession is programming. I'm currently (since Jan/22) the CTO (and a Co-Founder) at [AGXWorld](https://agxworld.com/). We develop a modern technology suite for logistics. It's a very specific solution for the vertical, and a fascinating approach to digitalizing a very rusty industry that has patches of software solutions here and there, but lacks vision and the drive to glue things together.

Before that I was a programmer, head of product, professional bug catcher, and swiss army knife at a [fintech company in Berlin](https://www.tillhub.de).

Other side projects are:

- [My engineering consulting and development agency](https://www.new-thread.de)
- [Meeting Activity Display based on google calendars free-busy API](https://freebusy.app)
- [**Spuffle Shuffler: shuffle public spotify playlist and generate a new one](https://spuffle-shuffler.web.app/#/)
- [Unmaintained: BAV Rechner](https://bav-werkzeug.de)

** My project is not [spuffle.net](https://spuffle.net/) - seems like someone had the same idea :)
