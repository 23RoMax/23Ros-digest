## A primer
This is dedicated to all the time spent in front of computers. Finding a true way to express oneself in projects, and beginning to make a small private blog a habit. In all it's glory, I will present you, the humble inventions, findings, and collections of myself, friends, family and fools. This website is built with [hugo](https://www.gohugo.io), where content is mainly written in markdown and insanely fast converted to a static website. I used to develop a lot of static websites without website generators just using frameworks like bootstrap or milligram and static html code, but a colleague and friend of mine [Robert Jefe Lindstaedt](https://eljefedelrodeo.com/) mentioned hugo a couple of times and this is ultimately the best solution ever for a problem I didn't know I am having. Thus I decided to create a new blog dedicated to technology, the business world around development, software engineering, my hobbies and little projects that I pursue to keep life interesting.

### Who am I?
My name is Maximilian and I also go by the cryptic name 23Ro.
You can find me here, on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximilian-nebl-87219846/), [my personal online CV](http://mndev.info/cv), on [github](https://github.com/23RoMax/), and also on a lot of other platforms. I'm a technical product owner, professional bug catcher, and developer myself (though development is not official my current profession). My skillset is based on a technological foundation, with some outreaches to academical economics, but I went quickly back to the more technical side of things working my way steadily up the stream of challenges we encounter on a daily basis combingin the world of development, product management, and non-technical business tasks. 

### Where am I?
Based and located in Berlin, Germany. Initially spawned in the most northern southern part of Germany (upper franconia), Coburg, I set out to do my things and eventually had the chance to live in several places on this planet during the last couple of years. Now I'm settled for good (at least for now) in Berlin.

## Roam free
For now, I'm happy to let you roam free.
