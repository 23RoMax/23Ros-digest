Hi there, great to have you!

My Name is Maximilian,

Nowadays I work as a CTO and programmer at [AGX](https://agxworld.com), but I managed to wear a few different hats in the industry as well.

I'm based in Berlin, Germany.

Initially spawned in the most northern region of southern Germany (upper franconia), Coburg, I set out to do my things and eventually had the chance to stay for longer periods in several places on this planet during the last couple of years (Hong Kong, Australia, Macao, Germany, Netherlands, Thailand). I enjoy travelling as much as the tranquility of a steady home with routine and structure.

Besides the passion for technology, I like

- sport (Hiking for the mind & the gym for staying in shape)
- photography
- 3d printing
- motorcycles (Cagiva Raptor 650 IE 2006 & Cagiva Mito Evo 2001)
- cars
- guitar playing
