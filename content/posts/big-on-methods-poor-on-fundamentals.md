Something about "Big on methods, poor on fundamentals." stuck with me. It appears to me that this is a factor on why I'm often getting stuck and/or don't find lasting solution anymore. I've given in to the ease of "buying" solutions versus understanding the problem and developing solutions. Gotta think first, go back to understanding the problem and investigating my own solutions before just jumping the gun on someone elses fixes that usually abstract the fundamentals away. No one else is fixing stuff for us, whether it is the next productivity guru on youtube, or a twitter thread with 10 steps to get rid of your dad bod.
