## Second entry - first commit
After setting things up initially in a Mac environment and creating a new post, why not doing the same for windows?
--> Bad idead
### Still, I'm getting it and slowly things are coming together
Setting Hugo up on a windows machine is not utterly complex, but also not as fluent of an experience as on linux, or mac. One might wonder why I have to deal with three different environments at all? It's just a habit of mine, to have all the tools I use at hand on every possible machine in my possesion. Which also includes a i7 XMG Schenker Gaming machine (which I barely use for gaming, but which indeed has win10 for this exact purpose installed) on which I'm in fact writing this entry now.
